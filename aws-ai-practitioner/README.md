### Module 1 : Introducing Generative AI

**Terms and Definitions**

- Artificial intelligence (AI):
  -  refers to machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

- Machine learning (ML) :
  - is a subset of AI in which systems learn from structured data and improve performance of a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed to do so. It takes a set of inputs and predicts an output based on an algorithm trained with labelled data.

- Deep learning (DL) :
  - is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from unstructured data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. DL is capable of taking in very large amounts of unlabeled data, but its goal is still to make a specific prediction.

- Generative AI :
  - is a sub-field of AI. It’s a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music

- Foundation Models
  - FMs are used by Generative AI
  - These are deep learning models that are trained on massive amounts of data and undergo extensive traning
  - Models might be trained for text, video, audio, image generation, customized outputs or multi-modal outputs such as financial models
  - Gen AI uses pre-trained FMs, making it attractive. It might have been challenging and resource-intensive using traditional ML approaces
