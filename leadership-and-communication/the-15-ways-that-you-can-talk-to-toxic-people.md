# The 15 ways that you can talk to Toxic People

### 1. Keep your responses short and neutral

Toxic people thrive on drama. The less emotion you show, the less they have to feed off

### 2. Set Clear Boundaries

Firmly state what you will and won't tolerate. Example: "I'm happy to discuss this, but only if we keep it respectful."

### 3. Don't Argue - Stay Calm and Focussed

Toxic people want to trigger you. If you stay composed, they lose their power.

### 4. Use "I" Statements Instead of "You" Statements

Say, "I need a respectful conversation", instead of, "You're always being rude". It reduces defensiveness.

### 5. Avoid Getting Pulled Into Their Negativity

Redirect the conversation or disengage when they try to drag you into gossip, drama, or complaints

### 6. Repeat Yourself if Needed

If they ignore your boundary, calmly restate it: "As I said, I won't discuss this right now."

### 7. Don't Take Their Words Personally

Their toxic behaviour is about them, not you. Remind yourself that their reaction doesn't define your worth.

### 8. Use Silence as a Response

Sometimes, the best way to shut down negativity is to say nothing at all

### 9. Avoid Trying to Change Them

You can't fix a toxic person, but you can control how you respond to them

### 10. Stick to the Facts, Not the Emotion

Keep the conversation focussed on facts and avoid letting emotions drive the discussion

### 11. Limit Your Exposure to Them

Minimise interactions and keep conversations brief when possible

### 12. Redirect the Conversation

If they start complaning, shift the topic: "Let's focus on what we can do to fix this"

### 13. Have an Exit Strategy

If they won't stop being toxic, excuse yourself : "I need to get back to work - let's continue this later"

### 14. Use Humour to Diffuse Tension

A light-hearted comment can sometimes defuse negativity and shift the tone

### 15. Know When to Walk Away

If the conversation isn't productive, politely disengage: "I don't think this is going anywhere, so let's pause here."
